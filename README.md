A Snakemake workflow for `assembling bacterial genomes according to the standard operating procedure in the Clavel Lab`


## Usage

First, the conda environment can be installed using the following command

    snakemake --use-conda --conda-create-envs-only

Then, the workflow can be used with the default configuration file and 9 threads here:

    snakemake -c 9 --use-conda

Or using a custom one:

    snakemake --configfile config/er2.yaml -c 9 --use-conda

The usage of this workflow is described in the [Snakemake Workflow Catalog](https://snakemake.github.io/snakemake-workflow-catalog/?usage=cpauvert%2Fgenome-assembly-clavel).

If you use this workflow in a paper, don't forget to give credits to the authors by citing the URL of this (original) repository its DOI (see above).


## Changelog

* v2.0: Extended the assembly quality assessment to evaluate the compliance to the MIMAG and SeqCode criteria and output an aggregated summary table
* v1.1: Added a quality control by CheckM
* v1.0: Initial conversion of the Standard Operating Procedure used in the lab to a Snakemake workflow
